##  HI There!ü§ôüèæ


#### Here is a brief overview 

I wanted to build a personal and professional website that will not only display my technical ability
but also my ability to design a clean and aestically beautiful UI. My goals for the projected changed 
many times through the process. Overall I believe I have reached my goal in making something that is unique 
and truly tells who I am as a Developer. 



#### What Makes it Different 

My Portfolio is different from alot, as most developers choose to have a single page portfolio. This Portfolio 
contains alot more. Multiple pages, A blog, projects have their own slugs that allow me to blog about the specifics of the every project.

All data is being fed from my Sanity backend, which I embedded and also using ISR.
